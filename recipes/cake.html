    <p>Chocolate cake yummy</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>225g plain flour</li>
      <li>350g caster sugar</li>
      <li>85g cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
      <li>2 free-range eggs</li>
      <li>250ml milk</li>
      <li>125ml vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>250ml boiling water</li>
      <li>200g chocolate, broken into peices</li>
      <li>200ml double cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4. Grease and line two 20cm/8in sandwich tins.</li>
      <li>To make the cake, place all of the cake ingredients, except the boiling water, into a large mixing bowl. Using a wooden spoon, or electric whisk, beat the mixture until smooth and well combined. </li>
      <li>Add the boiling water to the mixture, a little at a time, until smooth. (The cake mixture will now be very liquid.)</li>
      <li>Divide the cake batter between the sandwich tins and bake in the oven for 25-35 minutes, or until the top is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.</li>
      <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and allow to cool completely, still in their tins, before icing.</li>
      <li>To make the chocolate ganache, heat the chocolate and cream in a saucepan over a low heat until the chocolate melts. Remove the pan from the heat and whisk the mixture until smooth, glossy and thickened. Set aside to cool for 1-2 hours, or until thick enough to spread over the cake.</li>
      <li>To assemble the cake, run a round-bladed knife around the inside of the cake tins to loosen the cakes. Carefully remove the cakes from the tins.</li>
      <li>Spread a little chocolate ganache over the top of one of the chocolate cakes, then carefully top with the other cake.</li>
      <li>Transfer the cake to a serving plate and ice the cake all over with the chocolate ganache, using a palette knife.</li>
    </ol>
